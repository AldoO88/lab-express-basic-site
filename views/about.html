        <H1>About Alan Turing</H1>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, 
                <br>and theoretical biologist.[6] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a bormalisation
                <br>of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpos computer. 
                <br>He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. </p></li>
            <li><p>Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree 
                <br>in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no 
                <br>questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove that the halting problem 
                <br>for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. 
                <br>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking 
                <br>centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. 
                <br> Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish 
                <br>bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking 
                <br>intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, includin the Battle of 
                the Atlantic.</p></li>
